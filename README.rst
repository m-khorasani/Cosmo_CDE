Cosmo_CDE
===================

Description
=============================

Cosmo_CDE is a fork of `CosmoMC Planck 2018 <https://github.com/cmbant/CosmoMC/tree/planck2018>`_. It utilizes an eighth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm to evaluate the Friedmann equation and incorporates the perturbed Klein-Gordon equation for the Cascading Dark Energy (CDE) model `paper <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.07631>`_. Furthermore, DESI BAO and Pantheon+ datasets are incorporated.  


Citing Cosmo_CDE
=============================

If you use Cosmo_CDE for your scientific work, please cite the following paper:

    | `ApJ 975 137, 2024 <https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad7b16>`_

as well as the original CAMB `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9911177>`_ and CosmoMC `paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0205436>`_.




Changes
=============================

The main changes are focused on `equation_ppf_CDE.f90 <https://github.com/m-khorasani/Cosmo_CDE/blob/planck2018/camb/equations_ppf_CDE.f90>`_ and `supernovae_JLA.f90 <https://github.com/m-khorasani/CosmoMC_CDE/blob/planck2018/source/supernovae_JLA.f90>`_. The former describes the numerical solutions for the eighth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm and the perturbed Klein-Gordon equation, and the latter has been modified to update the inverse covariance matrix of supernovae to incorporate the Pantheon+ datasets into the code.
